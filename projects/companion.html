            <p class="article-content">An android app that helped avoid roadblocks in hilly areas of India like Sikkim using crowsoucred real-time data. Partnered with Border Road Organisation (BRO) for providing verified alerts and helping authorities to clear raodblocks faster. The client APP was built on JAVA and Android MVC framework. 
            </p>
            <p class="article-content"> Consider Google Map but for hilly areas only and with real-time updates on roadblocks in areas with low to no-internet connectivity. The alerts were available and users could report roadblocks if they a mobile network in their devices, even without internet. Google Maps does not provide traffic alerts in hilly areas of India. This traffic alert feature even in plain/plateau areas was not readily available in India at the time.
            </p>
            <p>APP was launched by <b>Honorable Governor of Sikkim</b> and this was my first startup.</p>
